##  
# Permissions has AntiBuild, which prevents a player from destroying/placing blocks.
# To prevent a group of players then set the build: flag to false (build: false).
# If you want a group to be able to build then set it to true. 
##
# Groups can inherit from other groups.
#   To make a group inherit the permissions and info nodes from another
#   group, simply place the groups name in the "inheritance:" like so:
#
#   Example:
#       inheritance:
#           - Default
##
#   Wildcard Permission settings:
#
#       You can have wildcard nodes which encompass all nodes that match it.
#       For example, the node "modplugin.*" matches "modplugin.kick", "modplugin.ban",
#       "modplugin.settings.view", and so on.
#
##
#   A single asterisk means that this user/group has all permissions.
#       - '*'
##
#   Negated nodes are created by prefixing a normal node with "-".
#   They prevent less specific wildcard nodes from matching the negated node.
#   For example:
#   
#   permissions:
#       - 'foo.*'
#       - '-foo.bar'
#
#   In this case, the user/group will have "foo.foo", "foo.foobar", and so on, but not "foo.bar".
#
##
#   prefix: and suffix: do not do anything on their own.  You need another outside plugin
#   such as iChat or HeroChat in order for these to do anything.
